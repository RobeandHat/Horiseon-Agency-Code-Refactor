# Horiseon Marketing Agency Code Refactor**

## What I did with this code

This code was originally provided to me for refactoring and conversion to semantic HTML. The generic div tags and other non-semantic elements have been changed to follow semantic HTML. The links on the page have been fixed and the CSS has also been reorganized to follow the structure of the HTML. Comments were made in both the HTML and CSS files to better organize the different elements.
